Follow these to complete this subtask

The basic idea of this task is to understand how collaborated projects work on github 
 - Fork this repo 
 - Clone the forked repo to your local system
 - Implement a given algorithm in your favourite programming language  and commit
 - Push the file to the repository 
 - Make sure you pull the code using `git pull` before pushing your code
 - After pushing the code, give a pull request or a PR to the parent repo from which you have forked from
 - Your pull request will then be reviewed by the mentor
